Hi there~

I'm Weipeng Zhang and you can call me Y.Paang (much easier to pronounce).

I'm currently an MSDS student at Northeastern University, Boston, US. I'm a machine learning and data mining enthusiast and have work experience in data engineering.

I love to spend my spare time participating in Kaggle competitions. I'm currently a Kaggle Competition Expert and have won 2 silver medals (one recently) so far.
