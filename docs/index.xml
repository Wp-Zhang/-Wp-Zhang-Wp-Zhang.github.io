      <description>There are two very important types of relationships between products: substitute and complementary. Substitute products are those that are interchangeable while complementary products are those that might be purchased in addition. For example, when a user is looking at a T-shirt, substitute products are other different types of T-shirts and complementary products can be shorts, hoodies or jackets. Swing is designed for substitute relationships and Surprise is designed for complementary relationships.</description>

      <description>UserCF UserCF uses ratings of the target item from top N similar users to predict the rating from the current user. There are mainly two steps:
Steps 1. Calculate similarities between users. There are three common ways of calculating user similarities:
a. Jaccard Similarity: $$J_{u,v} = \frac{|N(u) \cap N(v)|}{|N(u) \cup N(v)|}$$ $N(u)$ denotes the interacted item set of user $u$.
b. Cosine Similarity: $$cos(u,v) = \frac{u\cdot v}{|u|\cdot|v|}$$ $u$ and $v$ denote the rating vectors of two users respectively.</description>
